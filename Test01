The following types of automatic forwarding are available in Microsoft 365:

- Users can configure [Inbox rules](https://support.microsoft.com/office/c24f5dea-9465-4df4-ad17-a50704d66c59) to automatically forward messages to external senders (deliberately or as a result of a compromised account).

**To list mailboxes that have forwarding enabled via Inbox Rules:**
```
 `*PS C:\Users\Joe\Documents\Useful_PS_Scripts> .\Get_InboxRule_forwarding.ps1*`
```

- Admins can configure [mailbox forwarding](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/exchange/recipients-in-exchange-online/manage-user-mailboxes/configure-email-forwarding) (also known as _SMTP forwarding_) to automatically forward messages to external recipients. The admin can choose whether to forward messages, or keep copies of forwarded messages in the mailbox.

**To list all mailboxes with administrator-set forwarding:**
```
`*Get-Mailbox -ResultSize Unlimited | Where-Object { $_.ForwardingAddress -ne $null -or $_.ForwardingSMTPAddress -ne $null } | Select-Object DisplayName, UserPrincipalName, ForwardingAddress, ForwardingSMTPAddress, DeliverToMailboxAndForward*`
```

> - Automatic forwarding of messages between internal users isn't affected by the settings in outbound spam filter policies.
